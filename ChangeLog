ChangeLog from useofrplinfo from 31 to 39:

Changelog from v31 to 32: [https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-32.txt]

Section 2:
- Definition of "RPL Leaf" added.
- Definition of "RPL-aware-node (RAN)" added.
- Correction of RAL and RUL.

Section 4.1:
- Added a subsection: Updates to RFC6550: Advertise External Routes with Non-Storing Mode Signaling.

Section 4.4:
- Updated Figure 5 changed from "IPv6-in-IPv6 6LoRH" to IP-in-IP 6LoRH.

Section 5:
- Clarification added: "6LBR has direct access to Internet and is the root of the DODAG"
- Assumption deleted: The leaf can be a router 6LR or a host, both indicated as 6LN
- Assumptions added:
    *In the uses cases, we assume that the RAL supports IP-in-IP encapsulation.
    * In the uses cases, we dont assume that the RUL supports IP-in-IP encapsulation.

Section 7:
-Figure 7 changed:
  * RUL to root from root to hop or root
  * RUL to Int from root to hop or root
  * Int to RUL from root to hop or root
  * Int to RUL from hop to 6LR
  * RUL to RUL from hop to 6LR

- Changes as well on these cases to reflect the change.

Section 14.1
- Added a normative reference to RFC8504
- Nits fixed in the whole Document.

Changelog from v32 to 33: [https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-33.txt]

Abstract:
-Changed RPL Option Type to RPI Option Type.

Introduction:
-Clarification added about RPI.

Section 2:
- RPI definition added.

Section 4.2:
-Clarification added about RPI.
- Text deleted: A network which is switching from straight 6LoWPAN compression mechanism to those described in [RFC8138] will experience a flag day in the data compression anyway, and if possible this change can be deployed at the same time.

Section 4.3:
-Added clarification that the DODAG Configuration Option might indicate something different when MOP > 7.
-Text added: "If the flag is received with a value zero (which is the default), then new nodes will remain in RFC6553 Compatible Mode; originating traffic with the old-RPI Option Type (0x63) value.  If the flag is received with a value of 1, then the	option value for the RPL Option MUST be set to 0x23".

Nits fixed in the whole document.

Changelog from v33 to 34:[https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-34.txt]

Introduction:
- Text added: " ...In the other direction, for traffic coming from an external target into the LLN, the parent (6LR) that injects the traffic always encapsulates to the root..."

Section 7:
-Hop-by-hop deleted from table and cases.
-Figure 7 changed:
 *RUL to root from hop or root to root
 *RUL to Int from hop or root to root
 *RUL to RAL from RAL to root/RAL
 *RUL to RUL from 6LR to root/6LR
-Changes in the mentioned case's sections to reflect the deletion of hop-by-hop cases.
-Changed on all tables: "Modified headers" row moved from fifth to third row.

Section 7.3.2:
- Change in the case from RAL to RUL in order to reflect the common parent is the root (6LBR)

Section 7.3.3:
-Change in the case from RUL to RAL in order to reflect the common parent is the root (6LBR)

Nits fixed in the whole document.

Changelog from v34 to 35:[https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-35.txt]

Section 7:
- Figure 7 changed:
* RUL to RAL: changed from root/RAL to root
* RUL to RUL: changed from root/RAL to root

Section 8:N-SM
- Introduction of "may" cases that involves the optional IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation.
-Thereby text added:" The term "may(up)" refers that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header may
 	   be necessary in the upwards direction.  The term "must(up)" refers
 	   that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header must be present in the upwards
 	   direction.  The term "must(down)" refers that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header
 	   must be present in the downward direction."
-Figure 14: modified -cases:
 * RAL to Int: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "No" to "may(up)" and IP-in-IP dst column to root.
 * RAL to RAL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "may(up) and must (down)" and IP-in-IP dst column from root/RAL to root for up and RAL for down.
 * RAL to RUL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "may(up) and must (down)" and IP-in-IP dst column from root/6LR to root for up and 6LR for down.
 * RUL to RAL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "must(up) and must (down)" and IP-in-IP dst column from root/RAL to root for up and RAL for down.
 * RUL to RUL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "must(up) and must (down)" and IP-in-IP dst column from root/6LR to root for up and 6LR for down.
- Changed in the mentioned cases such as update description and add extra tabl, in order to reflect the optional encapsulation.
Nits fixed.

Changelog from v35 to 36:[https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-36.txt]

RFC Editor nits fixed.


Changelog from v36 to 37:[https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-37.txt]

Section 4.3:
- Clarification added in case of node reboot.

Section 6:
 - Two assumptions added:
 * For traffic leaving a RUL, if the RUL adds an opaque RPI then	the description of the RAL applies.
 * The description for RALs applies to RAN in general.

Section 7:
- Text added:"  In each case, 6LR_i represents the intermediate routers from source to destination.  "1 <= i <= n", n is the number of routers (6LR) that
   the packet goes through from source (6LN) to destination"
- Figure 7: cases modified:
 * root to RUL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "No" to "must" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column from "No" to "6LR".
 * RAL to Int: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "No" to "may" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column from "No" to "root".
 * RAL to RUL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "No" to "must(down)" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column from "No" to "6LR".
 * RUL to RAL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "must(up)/must(down)" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column from "root" to "root" going up and RAL doing down.
 * RUL to RUL: IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must" to "must(up)/must(down)" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column from "root" to "root" going up and 6LR doing down.

 -Changed in the mentioned cases (descriptions and tables) to reflect the modifications in Figure 7.

 Nits fixed.


Changelog from v37 to 38: [https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-38.txt]

Section 2:
-Hop-by-Hop re-encapsulation definition deleted.

Section 4:
-Text deleted: "IP-in-IP encapsulation MAY be avoided for Root to RUL communication if the RUL is known to process  the packets as forwarded by the parent 6LR without decapsulation."

Section 4.3:
-Text deleted:"This means that the non-storing mode case can avoid ever using Hop-by-Hop re-encapsulation headers for traffic	originating from the root to the leaves."

Section 7:
- Added text referring one case in SM that RH3 can be used: "However, there is one
  scenario (from the root to the RUL in SM) where the RH3 can be used to indicate the RUL (Figure 11)."

Figure 7, RAL to RUL case modified:
-"IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must(down)" to "No(up)/must(down)" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column keeps "6LR".

Section 7.1.3: SM -Example of Flow from Root to RUL:
-Text added:"IP-in-IP encapsulation MAY be avoided for Root to RUL communication.
 	   In SM, it can be replaced by a loose SRH header that indicates the
 	   RUL, in which case the packet is routed to the 6LR as a normal SM
 	   operation, then the 6LR forwards to the RUL based on the SRH, and the
 	   RUL ignores both the consumed SRH and the RPI, as in Non-Storing
 	   Mode." Figure 11 added to reflect this case.

Section 8.3.1:
- Text added:"Note that in the Modified headers row, going up in each 6LR_ia only the
 	   RPI1 is changed.  Going down, in each 6LR_id the IPv6 header is
 	   swapped with the SRH so both are changed alongside with the RPI2." and figure modified.

Nit fixed, tables(figures) aligned to ascii format
