Changelog from v32 to 33: [https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-33.txt]

Abstract:
-Changed RPL Option Type to RPI Option Type.

Introduction:
-Clarification added about RPI.

Section 2:
- RPI definition added.

Section 4.2:
-Clarification added about RPI.
- Text deleted: A network which is switching from straight 6LoWPAN compression mechanism to those described in [RFC8138]
will experience a flag day in the data compression anyway, and if possible this change can be deployed at the same time.

Section 4.3:
-Added clarification that the DODAG Configuration Option might indicate something different when MOP > 7.
-Text added: "If the flag is received with a value zero (which is the default), then new nodes will remain in RFC6553 
Compatible Mode; originating traffic with the old-RPI Option Type (0x63) value.  
If the flag is received with a value of 1, then the	option value for the RPL Option MUST be set to 0x23".

Nits fixed in the whole document.

-Thereby text added:" The term "may(up)" refers that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header may
 	   be necessary in the upwards direction.  The term "must(up)" refers
 	   that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header must be present in the upwards
 	   direction.  The term "must(down)" refers that the IPv6-in-IPv6 header
 	   must be present in the downward direction."

Changelog from v37 to 38: [https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-roll-useofrplinfo-38.txt]

Section 2:
-Hop-by-Hop re-encapsulation definition deleted.

Section 4:
-Text deleted: "IP-in-IP encapsulation MAY be avoided for Root to RUL communication if the RUL is known to process  
the packets as forwarded by the parent 6LR without decapsulation."

Section 4.3:
-Text deleted:"This means that the non-storing mode case can avoid ever using Hop-by-Hop re-encapsulation headers 
for traffic	originating from the root to the leaves."

Section 7:
- Added text referring one case in SM that RH3 can be used: "However, there is one
  scenario (from the root to the RUL in SM) where the RH3 can be used to indicate the RUL (Figure 11)."

Figure 7, RAL to RUL case modified:
-"IPv6-in-IPv6 column changed from "must(down)" to "No(up)/must(down)" and IPv6-in-IPv6 dst column keeps "6LR".

Section 7.1.3: SM -Example of Flow from Root to RUL:
-Text added:"IP-in-IP encapsulation MAY be avoided for Root to RUL communication.
 	   In SM, it can be replaced by a loose SRH header that indicates the
 	   RUL, in which case the packet is routed to the 6LR as a normal SM
 	   operation, then the 6LR forwards to the RUL based on the SRH, and the
 	   RUL ignores both the consumed SRH and the RPI, as in Non-Storing
 	   Mode." Figure 11 added to reflect this case.

Section 8.3.1:
- Text added:"Note that in the Modified headers row, going up in each 6LR_ia only the
 	   RPI1 is changed.  Going down, in each 6LR_id the IPv6 header is
 	   swapped with the SRH so both are changed alongside with the RPI2." and figure modified.

Nit fixed, tables(figures) aligned to ascii format

It is recommended that a network process bothoptions to enable interoperability " changed to " 
As mentioned previously, indicating the new RPI in the DODAG Configuration option flag is a way to avoid
the flag day (lack of interoperation) in a network using 0x63 as the RPI Option Type value.  
It is suggested that RPL implementations accept both 0x63 and 0x23 RPI Option type values when processing the header
to enable interoperability."

Nits fixed.
